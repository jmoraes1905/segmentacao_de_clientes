This program uses the RFM model to segment clients of an company. 
I use the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment each client concerning each feature of the RFM model,
after uncovering the optmum number of clusters. Finally, I stabilished a pointing system based on the clustering process
and segment the clients according to their rank.
